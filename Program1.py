# Homework Question:
# 
# You are given a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a student and their scores 
# in different subjects.
# 
# Student Data:
# students = [
#     {"name": "Alice", "scores": {"Math": 85, "Science": 90, "English": 78}},
#     {"name": "Bob", "scores": {"Math": 70, "Science": 88, "English": 82}},
#     {"name": "Charlie", "scores": {"Math": 92, "Science": 81, "English": 89}},
#     {"name": "David", "scores": {"Math": 60, "Science": 75, "English": 80}}
# ]

#Write a Python program that:
# 1. Calculates the average score for each student.
# 2. Stores these averages in a new dictionary where the studentâ€™s name is the key and their average score is the value.
# 3. Prints the names of students whose average score is greater than 80.

# Your task is to calculate the average scores for each student and print the names of students
# whose average score is greater than 80.

#Solution
